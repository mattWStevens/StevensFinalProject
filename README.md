This is an interactive 3D heatmap for traffic stops in Connecticut.

It features an animate button that when pressed will play an animation of the 3D plot. When pressed again, the animation will stop.
Pressing the reset button will reset the plot to its original settings. The camera can be controlled via the arrow keys of the keyboard.

NOTE: The camera is initially positioned above the heatmap looking down at it.

The controls are as follows:

     UP: Moves the camera down (forward) into the heatmap
     DOWN: Moves the camera up (away) from the heatmap
     LEFT: Moves the camera to the left
     RIGHT: Moves the camera to the right
  
The controls above are for chrome browsers.

The color scale for the heatmap is as follows (from least to greatest):

     dark blue
     red
     pink
     yellow
